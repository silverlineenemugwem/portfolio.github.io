											<h3>GLOBAL ELECTRONICS (POWER BI)</h3>
																												
											
											<p>This data analysis was performed for  the understanding of the sum of profit generated by the sales of the products and the performance of the stores.</p>
											<h4>Details About Dataset</h4>
											<p>This dataset conveys the details of sales of products by Global Electronics which contains six tables, namely; customers table, products table, sales tables, stores table, exchange rates table, and data dictionary table. These tables are in .csv file format.</p>
											<p>Customer table contains customer details such as name, gender, state, and country.  The products table contains details about the products such as product key, product name, brand, color, unit cost in USD, Unit price in USD, subcategory, and category. 
												The sales table contains sales details such as order number, order date, delivery date, customer key, store key, product key, quantity and currency code. The store table contains store key, country, state, open date. The exchange rate table contains details
												 such as date, currency, and exchange rate. And the dictionary table contains the details about the tables and the columns in each table.</p>
											<h4>Data Analysis</h4>
											<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
												<li>Power Bi was used to transform, clean, and merge the tables to extract and analyze data from 6 related tables. </li>
												<li>Calculated columns and calculated measures were used to draw insight from the table. The dataset was transformed and filtered by using aggregating and filtering function to improve reporting process.</li>
												<li>The insights were visualized by creating a dashboard to identify key performance indicators such as percentage profit, store with the highest and lowest profit, and the month with the lowest profit.</li>
											</ul>
											
											<h4>Result/Insight</h4>
											<p>The data analysis has revealed an increase in profit from 2016 to 2019. The year 2016 had a profit of $4.107M while 2019 had a profit of $10.698M, which is a 160.48% increase. The data also showed a decline in profit from year 2020 and 2021. Year 2020 shows a 49.08% decrease in profit from year 2019. The percentage profit of 2021 is not calculated because it is not a full fiscal year. </p>
											<p>February had the highest profit which is 1,187.44% higher than April, which had the lowest profit. February accounted for 14.14% of Sum of Profit. The computer categories and the cell phones categories were the highest profit generating categories in February of years 2018 to 2021.</p>
											<p>At $6.673M, the online store (with storekey 0) had the highest profit and was 70,045.76% higher than storekey 2 located in Northern Australia, which had the lowest profit at $9,513.  The online store accounted for 20.43% of the total profit.  Across all 58 stores (having 58 storekeys), sum of profit ranged from $9,512.610 to $6,672,692.640.</p>
											<p>Total Profit and total quantity of products sold are positively correlated with each other.  
											<h4>Recommendation</h4>
											<p>The data showed that April had the least sales. Why? The sales procedures in April should be looked into, and also, marketing department should come up with strategies that can possibly increase sales especially is April.</p>
											<p>More investigation is recommended in order to determine the reason for the decline in sales from year 2020.</p>

											<h3>CRM SALES (MICROSOFT EXCEL) </h3>
											
											<p>	The purpose of this data analysis is to seek insight from the CRM sales dataset that can lead to increasing sales opportunity. The dataset revealed the need for on-time documentation of prospective clients.</p>
											<h4>Details About Dataset</h4>
											<p>This dataset presents the details of CRM sales opportunities contained in five tables stored in Microsoft Excel format (.xlsx). The tables are accounts, sales pipeline, sales teams, products, and data dictionary.</p>
											<p>The accounts table contains customer accounts details, sale pipeline table contains the details about sales, sales teams table contain details of the sales agent, the products table contain details about the products, and the dictionary table contains the details of the tables and the columns in each table.</p>
											<h4>Data Analysis</h4>
											<P>Microsoft Excel was used for this data analysis to transform the dataset, remove duplicate data, create calculated columns, and draw insights from the five worksheets in the workbook. Pivot tables were created for analyzing, exploring, and presenting the summarized data. Pivot charts were used to create visualizations for understanding the trends and patterns, and a dashboard for professional report</P>
											<h4>Result/Insight</h4>
											<p> The insight from the analysis shows that the registered “prospective” customers are three times less than “engaged” customers, and they are from two managers only out of six managers. The won deals are two times that of the lost deals and majority of the customers are based in the United States. The data also shows that the customers made more decisions about the product before a month from time of presentation. GTX-BASIC is the most requested product while the GTK-500 is the least requested.</p>
											<h4>Recommendation for Growth</h4>
											<p></p>From the dataset, we see that more decisions concerning deals were concluded before a month time from the time of presentation. This indicates that presentation of products to prospective customers has to be very accurate, which implies that a lot of effort has to be made to understand the customer and the needs of the customer before approaching the customer, and this requires research and preparation. Due to the need for this research and preparation before meeting the customer, information about prospective customers is needed. It is suggested that  all managers and sales agents should locate and register their prospecting clients on time, as this will be used for intense research on the customers to understand their needs, requirements, budget, etc.
